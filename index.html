            <p>Based in Paris, Nabani has done a variety of modelling work, from a detail-oriented shoot and
                beauty shot with Wallpaper magazine to more conventional commercial and editorial shoots. Simone
                utilizes a blog page on her modelling portfolio to share updates and latest shots of her work.</p>

            <h2>Parsue The Next Goal</h2>

            <p>French model Nabani shows off her versatile portfolio with experience in lookbooks, fashion, editorial
                and agency work. Estelleâ€™s portfolio has a lot of consistency despite the use of different styles of
                modeling and photography. One of the key elements to the consistency in her portfolio is a filmic and
                vintage look to a lot of her photos. The choice of a simple horizontal scroll website allows you to
                easily scroll through her portfolio like a book.</p>
